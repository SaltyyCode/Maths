# Maths Project

This repo is a summuary of all maths project done during my first year at Epitech ! 

Here are all the projects listed : 

-> 101Pong : The goal of this project is to work on a 3D version of this game (or of the Breakout game. . . ). Only one paddle
will be considered, located in the (Oxy) plane (which is defined by the equation z = 0).

-> 102Architect : The goald of this project is to create a program to compute the coordinates of a point after several transformations. To
make it nice and clean, you chose to use homogeneous coordinates. O being the origin of both axis

-> 103Cipher : using the following process to encrypt :
• Transcript the key into numbers using the ASCII table,
• Convert the numbered key into a square matrix, the smallest possible size, and filling the lines first,
• Transcript the clear message into numbers using the ASCII table,
• Convert the numbered message into a matrix; its number of columns should fit the key matrix size,
and its number of lines should be as small as possible,
• Multiply the 2 matrices, and write the answer linearly to get the encrypted message.

-> 106Bombyx :
